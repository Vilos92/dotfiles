# This script performs a ONE-WAY MIRROR backup.
#
# The LaCie drives ("Lacie" and "LaCie Small") are the DESTINATION. They are
# intended to be an exact copy of the source files.
#
# Data flows FROM:
#   - /Volumes/Elements/
#   - ~/Desktop/Mac Vault/
#
# Data flows TO:
#   - /Volumes/Lacie/
#   - /Volumes/LaCie Small/
#
# Because this script uses the --delete flag, any file that exists on the
# LaCie drives but NOT on the source drives will be PERMANENTLY DELETED
# from the LaCie drives during the sync.
#
# DO NOT STORE UNIQUE FILES IN THE LACIE DRIVE VAULTS.
#
# The only exception to this is the `Cold Local Vault`. These are permanently archived
# files that no longer add utility (they have been scrapped for parts).
